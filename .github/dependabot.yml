updates:
  # =============================================================================
  # npm ecosystems
  # =============================================================================
  # Note: We only monitor directories with actual dependencies declared.
  # /enterprise/web-frontend and /premium/web-frontend are excluded because
  # they currently have no dependencies in their package.json files.
  # /integrations/zapier and /plugin-boilerplate are excluded intentionally.

  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/web-frontend"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"

  # =============================================================================
  # uv (Python) ecosystem
  # =============================================================================
  # Note: We only monitor /backend because it manages the uv workspace centrally.
  # The workspace is defined in backend/pyproject.toml with members including
  # ../premium/backend and ../enterprise/backend, and backend/uv.lock contains
  # all resolved dependencies. Separate entries for enterprise/premium backends
  # would be redundant and cause duplicate update runs.
